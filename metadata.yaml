description: Ralph and Diane are a married pair of down-on-their-luck miners. Penniless
  and without a solid plan, they're making their way toward a fresh start when their
  spacecraft begins behaving strangely. Suddenly, they find themselves marooned in
  a little-known void filled with one danger after another. Will they ever be able
  to escape the graveyard of space?
